# Isaac Rice Store Calculator ðŸ’°

A simple console-based calculator built in C++ that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using a switch statement.

## Features

- Supports the following operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Handles division by zero with an error message.
- Displays a humorous message when an invalid operator is entered.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
    ```
   
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example, using g++:
    ```bash
    g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
    ```

3. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./calculator
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts:
   - Enter the first number.
   - Enter the second number.
   - Enter your preferred operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).

## Example Usage


## Code Explanation

- The program uses a `switch` statement to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user input.
- If division is selected, the program checks to ensure the second number is not zero to avoid a division error.
- If an invalid operator is entered, a default message is displayed.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Basic knowledge of running terminal commands.
